# dynamic icons

This is a node-based server that returns a PNG image that will scale, rotate, and colorize image, based on these URL params:

```
dir     direction
alt     altitude
hex     hex-identifier
```

It's deployed [here](https://dynamic-icons.vercel.app/api)

Use it for making static maps with image-markers.
