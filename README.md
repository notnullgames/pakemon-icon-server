# dynamic icons

This is a node-based server that returns a PNG image that will scale, rotate, and colorize image, based on these URL params:

```
rot     rotation, in degrees
alt     altitude (for scale)
hex     hex-identifier (color, later)
```

It's deployed [here](https://dynamic-icons.vercel.app/api?alt=30000)

Use it for making static maps with image-markers in maps on [Pak√©mon](https://github.com/notnullgames//pakemon).
